How has the Cowboys' strategy of managing contracts affected their dead cap situation?,"[""While this might be an extreme example, the idea of having a top-heavy roster isn't new for the Cowboys. Over the past 25 years, they have been the most extreme example of a team willing to pay top dollar for a few (often homegrown) stars to serve as the core of their roster, even if it means having less depth than most other teams. They typically executed that philosophy by handing out long contracts and repeatedly restructuring bonuses to create short-term cap space at the expense of eventual dead cap when that player leaves. It ended up costing them edge rusher DeMarcus Ware for cap purposes -- the future Hall of Famer was released in 2014 -- and limited their ability to build around Prescott when he was on a bargain-basement deal, given that they were stuck paying out millions in dead money for Tony Romo's deal after the long-time quarterback starter was released in 2017.""]","The Cowboys' strategy of managing contracts by handing out long contracts and repeatedly restructuring bonuses to create short-term cap space has resulted in significant dead cap issues.
