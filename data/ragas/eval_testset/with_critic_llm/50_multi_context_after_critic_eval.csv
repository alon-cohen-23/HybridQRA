"How can Milwaukee optimize Lillard, Antetokounmpo, and Rivers' synergy in the offseason and training camp?","To optimize the synergy between Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Doc Rivers during the offseason and training camp, the Milwaukee Bucks should:

How have the Cowboys' long-term contracts and bonus restructuring affected their QB salary management and roster depth?,"The Cowboys' long-term contracts and bonus restructuring have created a top-heavy roster, committing high salaries to a few star players at the expense of overall roster depth.

Over the past 25 years, they have been the most extreme example of a team willing to pay top dollar for a few (often homegrown) stars to serve as the core of their roster, even if it means having less depth than most other teams. They typically executed that philosophy by handing out long contracts and repeatedly restructuring bonuses to create short-term cap space at the expense of eventual dead cap when that player leaves. It ended up costing them edge rusher DeMarcus Ware for cap purposes -- the future Hall of Famer was released in 2014 -- and limited their ability to build around Prescott when he was on a bargain-basement deal, given that they were stuck paying out millions in dead money for Tony Romo\'s deal after the long-time quarterback starter was released in 2017."", \'metadata\': {\'author\': \'Bill Barnwell\', \'content_publish_date\': \'Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET\', \'country\': \'us\', \'site\': \'espn\', \'title\': ""Dak Prescott\'s Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?""}}, {\'document\': ""With one year left to go on his rookie deal and no fifth-year option available, the Cowboys found themselves in the window in which virtually every team will sign their quarterback.

How did Doncic's passing and shooting impact Dallas's corner 3s and playoff run?,"Doncic's passing significantly impacted Dallas's corner 3s, with the Mavericks attempting more corner 3s than any other team during the season, totaling 924 attempts. Doncic led the league with 318 passes resulting in corner 3 attempts, and Dallas hit 40.4% of these shots during the postseason. His shooting was inconsistent; when he shot above his regular-season mark of 38%, Dallas performed well, but when he shot below that, the team's performance varied. Despite injuries and a shooting slump, Doncic remained a dominant force in the playoffs, contributing significantly to Dallas's playoff run.","['[{\'document\': ""On the flip side, Dallas -- powered by Doncic\'s incredible passing ability -- took more corner 3s than any other club during the season, with 924 attempts.
