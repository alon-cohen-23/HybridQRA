What was significant about the Giants' 1954 world championship win for Mays?,The Giants' 1954 world championship win was significant for Mays because it was his first full season after missing most of 1952 and all of 1953 due to military service.,"The significant aspect of the Giants' 1954 world championship win for Willie Mays was his iconic defensive play during Game 1 of the World Series. Mays made a legendary back-to-the-plate catch in deep center field against Cleveland's Vic Wertz, preventing two runs from scoring. This play is widely considered one of the most famous defensive moments in baseball history and was crucial in the Giants' ultimate victory in that game, which they won 5-2 in 10 innings.","[{'document': ""He was also a terrific defender -- probably the greatest defensive center fielder of all time.

In the 1954 World Series, Mays' back-to-the-plate catch in deep center against the Indians' Vic Wertz is considered the most famous defensive play of all time. Mays could throw as well as any center fielder; he would have had an assist at all four bases in one game, but Giants second baseman Tito Fuentes dropped the ball on a tag play.
