What financial impact does the new contract have on the Lions compared to using the franchise tag for Goff?,"The new contract for Jared Goff with the Lions is a four-year, $212 million deal, which averages $53.5 million per year. In contrast, if the Lions had used the nonexclusive franchise tag on Goff instead, the cost based on projections would have been significantly lower over the same period.

In summary, the financial impact is substantial: the new contract requires Goff to play through 2027 just to break even compared to the franchise tag approach.
