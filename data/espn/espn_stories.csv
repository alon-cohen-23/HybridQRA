They made minor moves in free agency -- signing veteran players such as linebacker Denzel Perryman, running back Gus Edwards, center Bradley Bozeman and tight end Hayden Hurst -- released high-priced receiver Mike Williams and traded receiver Keenan Allen, another costly veteran.

He allowed 1.3 yards per coverage snap (average for a corner) or better in each of the past five seasons, per NFL Next Gen Stats.

The Bears are in the unusual position of being able to draft an elite quarterback while possessing a capable roster, so why not go for it? Along with receivers DJ Moore and Rome Odunze and a solid offensive line, if Williams hits right away, the Bears' offense will be instantly dangerous and the team will be a legitimate contender. Speaking of Odunze, the Bears did well to resist trading up and still landed him with the No. 9 pick."

In 2021 and 2022, he recorded open scores of 79 and 80, indicating route-running ability that could unlock a higher level of play, especially for someone entering his age-25 season. And it's not like the Browns are giving him superstar compensation: His $17.5 million APY lags far behind the price of stars. We might look back on this trade and contract as a bargain for Cleveland, and I think it's a great bet for a team that needed another receiver, especially one with Jeudy's upside."

They added Jameis Winston (and Tyler Huntley) as their backups over Joe Flacco, which was fine given Flacco's age and lack of recent success prior to 2023. But they could have aimed higher. While the Browns are heavily invested in Deshaun Watson, he has played poorly enough in Cleveland that the team ought to look at alternatives rather than run out the clock on a talented roster.

Though he had a bounce-back season in which he ranked 18th in QBR, there's a reason Tampa Bay was able to sign Mayfield a year ago for just one year at $4 million. If the Bucs had guaranteed something like $27 million -- what Geno Smith got a year ago -- would anyone have topped that?

According to Roster Management, the Saints have $15 million in cap space despite quarterback Derek Carr, cornerback Marshon Lattimore, defensive end Cameron Jordan, quarterback/tight end Taysom Hill, offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk, linebacker Demario Davis, center Erik McCoy, safety Tyrann Mathieu and defensive Carl Granderson all having a base salary under $1.5 million to keep their 2024 cap hits low. Which is exactly why the team is $77.6 million over the salary cap in 2025 currently -- over $50 million more than any other team. A team could (maybe) justify this process if it was in a championship window, but that is not the Saints!"

Instead, the Saints are running it back with a 9-8 team led by Carr. The team's big move in free agency was signing Young to a one-year, fully guaranteed $13 million deal, a move I like. Young had an above-average 19% pass rush win rate at edge rusher in 2023 and could be a productive player for New Orleans in 2024, then potentially land the team a compensatory pick for signing elsewhere in free agency next year."

One advantage for Witt is in a couple of the deep analytic stats, such as win probability added and situational wins added. Both have killed it in high-leverage situations, but Witt has had a few more opportunities and rates higher. It also feels like anytime the Royals have had a big win, Witt has usually played a key role; he certainly has less help around him than Henderson has with the Orioles.

The talismanic young combination of Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala combined to complete 61 of 63 passes (39 of 40 in the attacking third), and each scored brilliantly set-up goals -- Wirtz's assisted by Joshua Kimmich, Musiala's by Kai Havertz -- to put the game out of reach within 20 minutes.

They won three matches and lost one, but they drew six times, three times in knockout-round matches (they won one penalty shootout and lost two). In those six draws, they scored four goals from shots worth a staggering 11.4 xG. For all of the brilliant passing Spain brings to the table, the actual shooting can abandon them. But not Saturday. Their three goals came from shots worth 1.9 xG, and I feel safe in saying that if Spain overachieves in that regard in this tournament, they immediately become one of the top three favorites, at worst."

Teams such as the Celtics that played deep into the NBA's 2020 bubble playoffs were hit hardest. It's surely no coincidence that only one of the four teams that reached the conference finals that year (the Denver Nuggets) won a playoff series in 2021, and none got back to the conference finals -- just the fourth time that had happened since the playoffs expanded to 16 teams in 1984."

MLB Draft Combine workouts started this week, some college stars are still playing at the Men's College World Series in Omaha, high school seasons are completed and pre-draft workouts for all the players mentioned below are now over."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","Industry evaluators' perception of the top of this draft class has taken a big step forward over the course of the season. It's a college-heavy group throughout the first round, with some solid high school and college pitching depth near the end of the round, and light on high school position players. The top tier of college hitters is so good it warranted a deep dive on those players to tease out the differences."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","With a clear tier of 10 players at the top (you can jump into my latest draft rankings for more on that), it's likely that group makes up eight or nine of the first 10 picks. I say eight or nine because financial incentives exist, given the draft's bonus pool structure, for at least one team in the top 10 picks to opt for saving for a later selection if they don't like the players and asking prices they're left with from that top group."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","Now let's predict the first 74 players to come off the board on Day 1 when this year's MLB Draft starts on Sunday, July 14."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","Here's a deep look at how the pick that will shape the rest of this draft could play out. I mentioned in my previous mock draft that 1-1 silly rumor season was in full swing with those in the industry guessing what value-based play Cleveland will make at the top pick. The Guardians are casting a wide net in conversations with representatives for players, indirectly encouraging this practice."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","I am pretty sure the Guardians have Chase Burns as the top college pitcher, Cam Caminiti as the top prep pitcher and Konnor Griffin as the top prep position player on their board. I don't think they can justify taking any of these players with the No. 1 pick when there are equivalent (and likely better) college position players available. That leaves us with four players they are most likely considering -- using their history, industry buzz and sourcing -- from the college position player demographic: Charlie Condon, Travis Bazzana, Jac Caglianone and Wetherholt."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","Condon is the best player in the draft in my mind and also to a majority of evaluators, but the buzz on what Cleveland thinks of him has been mixed. Is that misdirection or real? It's hard to say, but he is a corner player, maybe a corner outfielder, while the Guardians prefer up-the-middle prospects. Condon's bonus price is perceived to be the highest of the group as the consensus best player who is seemingly a lock to go in the first three picks."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","Bazzana fits the Guardians' draft style a bit better, thus he is the most common industry guess for who Cleveland will take. He also won't likely cut a huge deal since he won't go past Pick 4 and his camp knows he fits what Cleveland likes. Bazzana also is just fine as a defensive second baseman and an average-ish runner, so the up-the-middle bonafides aren't wildly stronger than Condon."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","There have been heavy rumors and some hard information that the Guardians have been all over Caglianone all spring. He has the elite tools you expect to see out of a top overall pick and there's the allure that dropping pitching will accelerate his growth at the plate. Ultimately, a corner-only, not particularly polished hitter doesn't fit Cleveland's history at all. I buy that they are entranced by his rare ability and seriously considering him (actually, I know they are), but I don't see them actually taking Caglianone No. 1 on draft day."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","That brings us to Wetherholt. He might be a major league shortstop and is definitely an infielder. He's basically above average at everything ranging from the elements of hitting to all five traditional physical tools. He's devalued a bit from playing in the Big 12 (rather than the SEC or ACC) and missing half the season with a hamstring strain while also not having a conventional physical look to a No. 1 pick. For all of these reasons, he may actually cut a deal -- especially since there doesn't seem to be a path for him to go in the top five other than at this pick. And there's a whiff of Jose Ramirez to his game, rumored to be the archetype Cleveland has been using in prioritizing hit-first, up-the-middle type players for close to a decade."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","That brings us to the last element here: the bonus price. The slot for the first pick is $10,570,600. A player is guaranteed to be offered 75% of that figure if he submits to the MLB Draft Combine medical. I assume all position players will, but that's also somewhat irrelevant for the No. 1 overall because an agent couldn't actually take under 75% of slot at 1-1 and be able to recruit elite players effectively again -- 75% of the top slot is $7,927,950. I narrowed the college position player bucket down to four because the player has to be worth $8 million. That 75% figure of the top slot falls between the fourth and fifth slots, which is a tick better than Wetherholt figures to go if he doesn't go No. 1 -- as I'd guess he then winds up in the No. 4 to No. 7 area, more likely the back end of that range."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","Let's add this all up: Taking Wetherholt here fits the Guardians' preferred type of player, fits their prioritization of bonus pool value and leans into the smart player demographic play. (For what it's worth, I may end up ranking him as high as third overall in my final rankings, so I'm also slowly talking myself into this point of view in my evaluation.) If Wetherholt takes 75% of slot at 1-1, that would give Cleveland nearly $3.5 million over the slot amounts for its remaining picks, if you combine the savings with their 5% overage. That means the Guardians could spend a little over $6 million -- above the slot price of the 10th pick -- on their next pick at 36th overall and still be able to pay full slot on every subsequent pick in the draft. That could be enough to float one of the prep players from the second paragraph of this blurb down the board."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","For their later picks, particularly if Caminiti or Griffin don't make it to their next pick, the Guardians will have lots of money to spend and have been tied mostly to prep pitchers -- William Schmidt, David Shields and Chase Mobley have been mentioned the most -- but they're also considering some high school shortstops, including Carter Johnson."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","The chatter from Reds execs all spring has been that they will go under slot here and they could go comfortably under the $9.785 million slot value and still set a record, which would best the $9.2 million bonus Paul Skenes got as the No. 1 pick last summer. Even a number just under $9 million here could still end up being the biggest bonus of this draft."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","The buzz has also been that if Cleveland passes on Condon, he'll go second, so it all adds up. Burns and Caglianone are the other most mentioned players here with some mixed sentiment on if Bazzana is a real option. The other industry speculation is that Cincinnati is looking to roll savings and possibly its overage into a prep pitcher, the deepest player demographic after the first round, at their next pick: No. 51 overall. I don't think the top five or so prep arms can get that far down the board, but that's something we'll find out on draft day. Late-rising Idaho prep righty Dax Whitney is a target who could make it to that pick."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","In this scenario, Burns, Caglianone and Bazzana are the options for Colorado with industry sentiment leaning toward Burns, though there are some that think Caglianone would be the pick in this scenario. The Rockies have leaned toward pitchers in the first round of late since they don't think they can sign frontline starters in free agency because of their ballpark, and last season they started drafting four-seam-oriented pitchers in Chase Dollander and Sean Sullivan after taking exclusively sinker-ballers for years. Burns is a four-seam type, pairing well with Dollander (a former teammate when both were at Tennessee) and is a potential ace, so all of Colorado's various tendencies can be satisfied. I think Burns/Caglianone, in this scenario, are the third and fifth picks in some order, a near coin flip at this point."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","Oakland has been heavily tied to Nick Kurtz all spring but in the event Bazzana gets here, this is believed to be his floor and the easy pick for the A's. Caglianone is in the mix and Braden Montgomery also gets mentioned here."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","Here or the next pick is probably as far as Caglianone could last. There's a persistent rumor that high schooler Konnor Griffin is in play here and I could see that happening if Cags isn't on the board here. Hagen Smith also fits Chicago's type -- he's a low arm slot lefty like recent first-rounders Garrett Crochet and Noah Schultz -- but Burns is perceived to be a bit higher on most boards, and the belief in the industry is that the White Sox want a position player here. Boston Bateman is one of a few prep pitchers who are rumored to be targets of the White Sox at a later pick, with Connor Foley the most rumored college pitcher for Chicago at a later pick."
espn,us,2024 MLB mock draft 2.0: Predicting the first two rounds,Kiley McDaniel,"Jun 19, 2024, 07:00 AM ET","This is where things really start to open up. Nearly every player in the top 10 has been tied to this pick at various times.The position players on the board here are all very tightly packed and one of the hitters in play here will likely last until Pick 12 or 13. I think any of Condon/Bazzana/Burns/Caglianone would be the pick if they fall here and I think Hagen Smith and Bryce Rainer are also in consideration, with James Tibbs as a likely cheaper option similar to Montgomery. The Royals are also tied to close to a dozen different prep pitchers with later picks, so saving to go big later could end up being the aim here if those top four players don't make it."

The Angels have been the most interesting team to track in the draft of late as they just rush their top few college picks to the big leagues and have found some success doing it. This year, the Rainer rumors are real, as the possible exception or maybe even pivot to this strategy; he should go by Pick 12. This is the first spot where the red-hot Tennessee 2B Christian Moore, the biggest Omaha riser, is getting traction, in case the Angels want to go back to fast-tracking college players on a discount. Catcher Walker Janek is rumored to be an even more extreme version of that. Montgomery, Nick Kurtz and James Tibbs have all been rumored here for some time. At their next pick, I think the Angels are the floor for fast-rising Louisiana SS Kyle DeBarge."

Caminiti (cousin of Ken) should go in the next few picks if he doesn't go here, and I think Griffin would also get a long look if he makes it to this pick. Kurtz, Tibbs and Yesavage also fit depending on where Detroit leans in terms of price and risk profile. It seems prep 3B Chase Harlan would be the choice for the Tigers' next pick if he's still available."

Caminiti and Yesavage are real options here, and the Giants like Billy Amick, though he likely lasts a bit longer.

This is probably the floor if either Kurtz or Tibbs makes it this far, and this is the first spot Malcolm Moore is a distinct option. Florida prep SS Kellon Lindsey is a potential well-under slot option as I think the Cubs are mostly looking at upside position players.

Porzingis, who attempted 6.2 3s per 36 minutes at a 37.5% clip, could force Dallas to pull its 7-footers out of the paint, limiting their defensive value.

I did a deep dive on Caglianone and other top hitters in the draft last week. Here's a summary: He chases bad pitches at a very high rate but is so physically talented that some scouts aren't that worried about it."

Colby Shelton has been surprisingly good at shortstop this spring. He has pretty average tools, but that's the scouting report of some low-end MLB regulars. Cade Kurland is a better defender with more pop, but has some swing-and-miss concerns. Righties Brandon Neely and Fisher Jameson fit in the fifth-to-seventh-round area in this year's draft with some traits that clubs with a specific pitching development point of view, like the Guardians, might target. For next year's draft -- beyond Kurland if he comes back -- lefty Cade Fisher, righty Jake Clemente, and catcher Brody Donay all have top-five-round upside and 2026-eligible righty Luke McNeillie is a silky smooth projection righty who could be an early-round pick with an extra couple of velo ticks."

There are some questions about Smith's position and how he'll fare against pro pitching. His swing was geared for power last year and produced a 29% strikeout rate, so he eliminated most of the pre-pitch movement and cut that rate in half while still posting huge exit velos. Some scouts worry that his swing now lacks rhythm, something that will become more essential as he gets closer to the big leagues, but he has All-Star upside if it clicks."

He was unknown to scouts entering his freshman year at Charleston Southern but put up big numbers, leading to a transfer to Lexington. He moved into the first-five-rounds conversation last season before tearing an ACL on the Cape during the summer. Upon returning, his draft range rose to the second round by midseason and is now up to the middle of the first round. He is a solid-average runner and a solid left fielder with a combination of bat control, pitch selection and in-game power that rivals Travis Bazzana for the best in the draft class. His momentum is building, and he's the best candidate to make millions with a strong showing in Omaha, like Cade Horton in 2022 and Will Bednar in 2021."

He was heralded as a potential No. 1 overall pick after an outstanding freshman year (.296 average, 1.079 OPS, 25 homers, 29 stolen bases, excellent defense in center field). He still has those tools and upside but has had some injuries, various adjustments in offensive approach, swing tweaks and a persistently high strikeout rate."

Some other teams aren't considering him in the middle of the first round and have even lower offensive expectations, tied to his in-zone miss rate (21% this year) and swing path. He could realistically go anywhere from picks 12 to 35 and have any sort of pro career from bust to making an MLB All-Star team, so he'll be among the most intriguing prospects to follow in pro ball."

Dalton Pence and Folger Boaz are 2025-eligible lefties, while 2026-eligible righties Jason Decaro and Olin Johnson could have even more upside. 2026-eligible infielder Gavin Gallaher is probably the best of this underclassman bunch."

Billy Amick also has plus-plus exit velos, feel for the bat head, and plays the infield, but has a little more chase than Moore. Blake Burke is limited to first base, also has plus-plus exit velos but has chase issues and his launch angle is a bit too flat for his big raw power. Kavares Tears is a traditional center fielder but, wait for it, also has plus-plus exit velos with enough feel for the bat to profile as a potential everyday player in pro ball."

Dylan Dreiling is also in that plus exit velos box and is limited to left field, so he's right on the borderline of potential pro platoon player or low-end regular. 2025-eligible catcher Cannon Peebles is also a potential top-five-rounder who scouts think will bounce back next season.

Now he's tracking like a top-two-rounds pick. Quietly, 2026-eligible outfielder Caden Sorrell was almost as good as Grahovac this spring and is also looking like an early-round pick."

Didawick is a left fielder with power and patience but has in-zone miss that limits his upside. Saucke is a former third baseman now playing right field and has an intriguing bat control/in-game power combo, but chases more than average and needs to add more lift.

espn,us,"2024 NBA free agency: Players to sign, contract predictions",Bobby Marks,"Jun 17, 2024, 07:15 AM ET","The art of negotiating a contract in free agency is not as simple as writing a blank check. A new contract for Paul George should start at his max salary of $49.3 million, but his next team, the LA Clippers or perhaps the Philadelphia 76ers, will negotiate the length and other clauses."
espn,us,"2024 NBA free agency: Players to sign, contract predictions",Bobby Marks,"Jun 17, 2024, 07:15 AM ET",The 34-year old is eligible to sign a four-year contract with either team and can also ask for a no-trade clause with the Clippers.

He continues to play as a top-15 player and recently earned All-NBA for a 20th consecutive season. He has earned the right to dictate the length and dollars on his next contract.
espn,us,"2024 NBA free agency: Players to sign, contract predictions",Bobby Marks,"Jun 17, 2024, 07:15 AM ET","But what happens if the next James contract starts at $40 million, $10 million dollars less of the maximum he can earn in the first year?"

They typically executed that philosophy by handing out long contracts and repeatedly restructuring bonuses to create short-term cap space at the expense of eventual dead cap when that player leaves. It ended up costing them edge rusher DeMarcus Ware for cap purposes -- the future Hall of Famer was released in 2014 -- and limited their ability to build around Prescott when he was on a bargain-basement deal, given that they were stuck paying out millions in dead money for Tony Romo's deal after the long-time quarterback starter was released in 2017."

Like Prescott, Cousins failed to convince his team he was worthy of a significant extension as his rookie deal expired. Unlike the Cowboys, though, Washington never recognized it lacked leverage and seemed content to insult Cousins through the media. After two franchise tags, Cousins left and signed a fully guaranteed three-year deal with the Vikings in free agency in 2018.

espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Anything's possible, but I'd be surprised if that were the case. There are a couple of key differences between the two. Jackson had shown a higher ceiling than Prescott and was younger than his Cowboys counterpart will be next offseason, but he's also a more unique player. A significant portion of Jackson's value has been what he offers as a runner, especially before throwing a career-high 457 passes last season in a more balanced attack under Todd Monken."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","There were always going to be teams that don't trust paying that much money to a quarterback who runs the ball as often as Jackson does or that didn't want to adapt their schemes to Jackson's set of skills. To be clear, I don't agree with those arguments; he's a wizard when it comes to avoiding big hits, and a team should mold its offense to its quarterback as opposed to the other way around. I'm confident, though, that more teams would see Prescott as a plug-and-play pocket quarterback than Jackson, which would expand his market."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","The other factor is cost. Jackson would have cost opposing teams two first-round picks if they had signed him via an offer sheet. Prescott wouldn't come with any draft compensation attached; the team that signs him would incur an opportunity cost and miss out on a potential compensatory pick if it lost a player during the 2025 free agent window, but that's nowhere near as significant of a potential loss as it would be to not sign him. Jackson also reportedly sought a fully guaranteed deal before settling for something less with the Ravens, while Prescott doesn't appear to have the same sort of demand."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","I also wonder if what happened with Jackson might cause teams to get more aggressive in free agency. Many of the teams that immediately announced they were out on Jackson last year disappointed and ended up making coaching changes. The Falcons fired Arthur Smith. The Commanders moved on from Ron Rivera. The Raiders sacked Josh McDaniels, and the Panthers let go of Frank Reich before the season even ended. Three of those teams made quarterback changes after the season was over, while Carolina instead chose to trade two first-round picks to acquire Young instead of going after Jackson. Would a team with a vulnerable coach see those results, consider that Jackson ended up winning league MVP after those teams passed and be more inclined to make a big-money move for Prescott?"

espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","We'll start with the easy one. The most logical thing for Dallas to do is repeat what happened last time around. After all the debate and maneuvering, the team ended up signing Prescott to a deal that was almost exactly what I projected before that season: four years and $160 million, for an average of $40 million per year."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","This time around, the magic number would be even higher. Prescott should push to become the first player in league history to earn $60 million per season. A four-year, $240 million contract would give him one more potential chance at free agency (or another lucrative extension) after the 2028 season, when he would be 35. He should push for getting $150 million fully guaranteed at signing, which would be the second most in NFL history behind Watson's deal. And he should land the same no-trade and no-tag clauses he picked up in his prior deal."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Anything short of $60 million would amount to a gift from Prescott to the Jones family. The passer said last month he doesn't ""play for money,"" but that hasn't been supported by what has happened in his negotiations. He could have signed up for life-changing money in an extension before the 2019 and 2020 seasons and chose to bet on himself instead. He could have gotten a deal done last offseason if the goal was to minimize friction and noise and didn't sign an extension. No contract was signed."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","There's nothing wrong with what Prescott's doing, to be clear. He shouldn't take anything less than his market value for the sole benefit of lining the pockets of the Jones family. There was pressure from former players on him to take less money during his last set of negotiations because of the commercial benefits he enjoys as the quarterback of the league's most prominent team, but that wasn't founded with any sense of history or reality. In 1993, Troy Aikman signed the largest contract in league history when he re-upped with the Cowboys. Emmitt Smith famously held out to become the highest-paid back in football into the start of the 1993 season before Jones caved. No Dallas player had taken less for the good of the team before Prescott, and none has since. Why should Prescott be the first?"
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","This doesn't make much sense to me, but it's entirely possible the Cowboys could get a deal done with Prescott during the season or once the season is completed, before the start of the 2025 league year. In 2020, he wasn't eligible to sign an extension after July because of the franchise tag rules, and he eventually inked his new deal in mid-March."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","The price would only go up in this scenario. Extensions for Jordan Love or Tua Tagovailoa could push the top of the quarterback market north of $55 million per season. The Chiefs could choose to re-do Patrick Mahomes's deal and make their future Hall of Famer the league's first $60 million man. As we saw in 2020, when Prescott was out for the season by mid-October and still got everything he wanted in a new contract, nothing is going to happen to make his cost go down. As the cap rises next year, he will only have more of an impetus to ask for a larger contract."

espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Trey Lance. He is the ultimate mystery, and another player who could justify an entire article of dispelling myths and answering questions. The Cowboys traded a fourth-round pick to the 49ers to acquire him before last season, suggesting they at least saw him as a reasonably valuable proposition to add to their roster. After he sat behind Prescott during, they unsurprisingly declined Lance's $22.4 million fifth-year option for 2025; they could still sign him to a smaller extension to keep him around, but at the moment, he is set to follow Prescott out the door."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Despite having just finished his third season in the league, Lance is still a remarkably young prospect. He just turned 24 years old, an age where plenty of quarterbacks are just entering the league. He's three months younger than Bo Nix and one day younger than Michael Penix Jr., two rookies from the 2024 draft class. He's nearly a full year younger than Will Levis, who was in the 2023 class. That in itself gives him some breathing room: He still has more time to develop, even though he has been in the league for nearly an entire rookie contract."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","The problem is that development, of course. Lance simply hasn't played much football. After throwing 287 passes in 2019 at North Dakota State, Lance was limited to one start in 2020 by the impact of COVID on the college season. After being drafted by the 49ers at No. 3 overall, he made two starts as a rookie and two more in his sophomore season before suffering a season-ending ankle injury, after which Brock Purdy emerged as the franchise's quarterback of the future. He has a total of 102 pass attempts as a pro, giving him 420 passes over six years since graduating from high school."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Did the 49ers give up on Lance because he was a failed prospect? Maybe, although that wasn't borne out by how he played on the field. In his rookie season, he posted a 97.3 passer rating, averaged 8.5 passing yards per attempt and ran for 168 yards on 38 attempts. He did that with a broken finger that impacted his throwing. San Francisco didn't seem concerned about his performance after that rookie season, as it prepared to trade Jimmy Garoppolo and installed Lance as its starter for Week 1 of the 2022 campaign."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","That week, Lance struggled in a game played amid monsoon conditions in Chicago, with the 49ers losing 19-10. The following week, he was 2-of-3 for 30 yards before suffering an ankle injury on a busted run play, ending his season. He hasn't taken a regular-season snap since. I don't think you can make a case that he doesn't at least have the potential to become an NFL starting quarterback."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Does Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers moving on from Lance prove he was a wasted pick? Maybe, but again, consider the context. The 49ers were transforming their offense to account for Lance. In 2021, Garoppolo averaged 7.3 air yards per throw, which ranked 29th among passers with at least 50 attempts. Lance's 10.2 air yards per throw ranked No. 1 in the league. He was going to be a more explosive downfield attacker, creating the sort of explosive plays Shanahan thrives off creating in the passing game."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","In addition, Lance quickly became part of the rushing attack via the quarterback run game, something Shanahan hadn't been able to implement in his offenses since his time with Robert Griffin in Washington. In his brief time with the 49ers, the Lance-led offense looked more like what the Eagles run with Jalen Hurts in terms of his impact on the ground. That might have faded over a full season or as he grew more comfortable as a passer, but the offense was going to have different elements with him under center in 2022."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Instead, Purdy was simply a better fit as a replacement for Garoppolo and as the latest in a series of pocket quarterbacks for Shanahan, following in the vein of Kirk Cousins, Matt Ryan and Garoppolo. That has worked out fantastically for San Francisco over the past couple of years, and there was no reason to go back to Lance once the team found Purdy to be a star. But it isn't as if Lance failed in his role. He was promising, then very wet, then very injured. And in the meantime, the 49ers traded for running back Christian McCaffrey, unlocked their offense and found a successful solution under center in Purdy."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Shanahan got to see Lance in practice, too, and it's entirely possible the star coach felt like his signal-caller wasn't going to develop into an elite player. Shanahan certainly deserves the benefit of the doubt, but he's also not infallible. That same season, he gave $2 million guaranteed to Nate Sudfeld, last seen tanking for the Eagles in the NFC East, to serve as the backup quarterback to Lance. When Garoppolo couldn't be dealt and ended up staying on the roster, the 49ers cut Sudfeld before he ever took a snap."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","If Lance could be a quarterback of the future, why did the 49ers only land a fourth-round pick for him when he was available for trade? Leverage and timing. After Purdy emerged as a star, the entire league knew they were going to shop Lance, having little need for him on their roster. With San Francisco trading the inexperienced Lance just before the start of the 2023 season, any team acquiring him was going to be stuck turning down his fifth-year option, meaning it was getting a raw backup and paying about $6.3 million over two years to do so."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Is Lance going to be a superstar in the way the 49ers hoped when they traded three first-round picks to grab him in the 2020 draft? Probably not. Is he a hopeless prospect because of what happened in San Francisco? Given his age and his level of play during his brief opportunities as a college and pro quarterback, I would argue that's unfair. Geno Smith spent seven years in the wilderness as a backup before eventually emerging as a useful starter for the Seahawks."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","If Lance ends up taking over as the starter, the Cowboys' offense might end up looking something like what Hurts runs in Philadelphia or what the Titans did with Ryan Tannehill in Tennessee. An offense that gets him on the move, relies on the run and uses his physical talent and arm strength to create windows and hit big plays off play-action would make sense. Dallas would probably bring in a veteran to compete with Lance, but if it signs him to a modest extension for 2025, it would make sense to see what it has."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Kirk Cousins. It would typically not be plausible to project a big-ticket free agent to leave after one season with his new team, but this isn't a typical situation. The Falcons drafted Penix just weeks after signing Cousins, signaling that the organization is thinking about its long-term answer at quarterback before its short-term solution even takes a snap in a Falcons uniform. While Cousins signed a four-year, $180 million deal, it would be a surprise if he was still on the Atlanta roster in 2026."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","Trading Cousins after one year would make sense if the Falcons want to begin the Penix era in 2025. They would have paid a whopping $62.5 million to Cousins for one season, but that's a sunk cost by now. Trading Cousins would leave the Falcons with $37.5 million in dead money on their cap next year, but it would save $2.5 million in cap space and free up $37.5 million in cash spend over the ensuing two years."
espn,us,Dak Prescott's Cowboys future: New contract or test free agency?,Bill Barnwell,"Jun 19, 2024, 06:15 AM ET","The Cowboys could commit to paying Cousins at least that $37.5 million for one year of work, with $27.5 million guaranteed in 2025 and another $10 million guaranteed for 2026, regardless of whether he is on the roster. If he sticks around, the Cowboys would pay him $72.5 million for two years, or an average of $36.3 million per season.

At about 60% of the price, though, they might be able to justify downgrading at quarterback if it allows them to keep more pieces around their quarterback. They also wouldn't need to dramatically change their offense with Cousins."

If the Saints disappoint this season, they likely would end up moving on from Carr, who only has $10 million in guarantees left on his deal after this season.

I would expect Jones to be benched by the end of the season, given that the Giants would be on the hook for $23 million next year if he suffers an injury that prevents him from passing a physical.

He did that with replacement-level receivers and middling offensive line play; signing Jones would probably cost no more than $10 million and allow Dallas to devote more resources to talent around him. In that scenario, I would expect Jones to be a bridge quarterback ahead of another option with a higher ceiling, but he could be part of the post-Prescott puzzle at the right price."

The 2018 No. 2 overall pick might not seem like an appealing option given his struggles with the Jets and Panthers, but he keeps getting opportunities with guaranteed money around the league. Last offseason, Darnold signed a one-year deal for $4.5 million with the 49ers and then won the No. 2 job ahead of Lance.

McCarthy in Round 1. Darnold will compete with McCarthy for the starting job in camp, and it wouldn't be a surprise if he made a few starts before giving way to McCarthy.

It would hardly be any trouble to pay Lamb, Cooks, tight end Jake Ferguson and several offensive linemen significant money, let alone key players on the defensive side of the ball.

They wanted to take Paxton Lynch in the first round, only for the Broncos to beat them to the punch. They were about to trade up and draft Connor Cook on Day 2, but the Raiders jumped ahead of them.

Prescott's lack of playoff success has to be disappointing. There's an argument to be made that teams should be more aggressive moving on from anyone who isn't an MVP-caliber quarterback given how much of a savings they can realize by going with an option on a rookie deal, although Prescott did just finish second in that balloting."

After failing to come to terms on a new deal before the 2018 league year, Washington lost him for nothing more than a compensatory pick in free agency.

Mays was Ken Griffey Jr., only better, and he preceded Griffey by 40 years. Mays won the National League Most Valuable Player in 1954 and 1965 and finished second two other times. He finished in the top six 12 times. He made the All-Star team 20 years in a row. He is, by most measures, the second-best all-around player in history behind the incomprehensibly great Babe Ruth. To those who separate the game by the breaking of the color barrier in 1947, there has never been a better player than Mays."

""The first time I met him [at the 1968 All-Star Game], the day before the game, he whispered in my ear, 'You should be starting the All-Star Game.' When he left, I couldn't even speak for a short time. It was like, 'Oh my God, Willie Mays just talked to me.' That's how great Willie was.''"

His father was a great center fielder, too. His son, Willie Howard Mays Jr., was so advanced growing up in Westfield, Alabama, that he played against 18-year-olds when he was 10. Mays played for the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues when he was 15. In 1950, at age 18, he signed with the New York Giants for $15,000 (he bought a car but couldn't drive it, so it became a car that his community drove). He spent two years in the minor leagues, then joined the Giants in May 1951 just after turning 20 years old. Durocher put him in the No. 3 spot in the order and, after a 1-for-25 start, he went on to win the Rookie of the Year Award and helped the Giants overcome a 13½-game deficit against the Dodgers to win the pennant. He was oblivious to the pressure. He was as natural a talent as anyone had ever seen."

Mays was as graceful a player as there has ever been, a majestic combination of speed and tremendous strength built into a 5-foot-11, 185-pound package. He played with a certain flair, a crowd-pleaser in every way. He was the ""Say Hey Kid."" There was no one like him."

He won 12 Gold Gloves, most of any center fielder, and they didn't start awarding Gold Gloves until 1957, his fifth full season. In 1968, he won a Gold Glove at age 37; at the time, he was the oldest to win one as a center fielder. In the 1954 World Series, Mays' back-to-the-plate catch in deep center against the Indians' Vic Wertz is considered the most famous defensive play of all time. Mays could throw as well as any center fielder; he would have had an assist at all four bases in one game, but Giants second baseman Tito Fuentes dropped the ball on a tag play. In 1965, Mays became the first player to win a Gold Glove in a 50-homer season. His signature basket catch was a phenomenon that has never been duplicated. No one glided after a fly ball like Willie Mays."

In 1962, Mays hit 49 homers, including one in the eighth inning of the final day of the season to beat the Astros 2-1 and pull the Giants into a regular-season tie with the Dodgers. They played a three-game playoff; the Giants beat Sandy Koufax in the first game 8-0 behind two homers by Mays. The Giants won two out of three to advance to the first World Series in San Francisco, but they lost in seven games to the Yankees.

Sadly, some people will remember him for falling down on the warning track as a 42-year-old in the 1973 World Series. But replace that picture with these images: The game's best athlete, streaking across the outfield, his cap flying off as he runs down a ball in right-center; that short, strong body uncoiling and hitting a ball to places only few can imagine; those legs churning on a steal of second, ending with a classic hook slide. Remember him as one of the two best players of all time, a man who changed the game, a man with talent that is unrivaled the past 75 years."
